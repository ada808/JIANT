/* (JIANT 0.9.4) Three engines draw their own creature where every other engine draws its being (ui_being.c): EDIT's
 * SOUND (ui_lzedit.c graph_sound_lz, on the left) and HOME's BEING (ui_lzhome.c, large in the middle); DRUM-X's kit
 * on EDIT > KIT and SOUND 1..4 (the whole panel), the colony staying on KIT 2, KIT 3 and X-MOD. Line art only,
 * antialiased (ui_organic.c og_line), in the beings' thermal colours (bg_col: heat_col; GREY and MONO their greys),
 * from small point tables (int8) and the synthesis state the UI already reads; nothing in the audio path. Each moves
 * only with its sound: in silence it rests (its time runs with the level, as the beings').
 *   VOICE   a sagittal CT of a head in profile (the face left): skin, the skull's two tables, the brain's folds, the
 *           corpus callosum, the cerebellum, the spine, the nasal cavity and its turbinates, the palate, the velum, the
 *           tongue, the mandible, the lips, the pharynx, the larynx and the trachea, each as dense as it is in a scan
 *           (bone hottest, air black). The vocal tract sings: the tongue's height from F1 and its front / back from F2
 *           (the vowel sounding: sing_view's formants with WORDS on, VOWEL / VOWEL2 / TALK without), the jaw open with
 *           F1, the lips rounded (o u w sh) or closed (p b m), the lower lip on the teeth (f v), the tongue's tip, blade
 *           or body on the place of the consonant (sing.c PHON[].place), the velum down for m n ng, the vocal folds
 *           shaking and the trachea's rings pulsing with the voicing, turbulence at the constriction for the frication
 *           (s sh f x, the bursts) and at the glottis for the aspiration (h, BREATH); a scan line sweeps down slowly.
 *   ANIMAL  a creature between a bird, an insect and a mammal: its outline, legs, wing, antennae / ears / crest are
 *           the same points in the three (VX_AN), mixed by weights that glide (a metamorphosis, ~0.6 s) to the MODE's
 *           animal (CMOS WHSTL a bird, PULSE WING an insect, GLOTT a mammal), leaned by SIZE past its presets' sizes
 *           (smaller: towards the insect; larger: the mammal) and stirred by CHAOS. With the call (each voice's syllable envelope, CMOS's
 *           chirp gate, WHSTL's syrinx amplitude): the beak / jaw opens and the throat (syrinx, larynx) swells, the
 *           wings buzz at the pulse rate (PULSE, WING), the legs stridulate, the ribs breathe (GLOTT).
 *   DRUM-X  the kit as a colony of small beings with eyes and a mouth, standing as a drum kit does: the kick large in
 *           the middle (its core hot), the snare flat on its stand, the toms on little legs, the hi-hat two shells (CH
 *           together, OH the top one lifted, its mouth open), the crash on a long stem and the cowbell a small head (BELL),
 *           the clap two little ones clapping together, the rim (RS) a spark on the snare's edge. A hit squashes its
 *           being (springing back), shuts its eyes and opens its mouth in a shout, as hard as the hit (the lane's own
 *           envelope: its velocity, its accent; it recovers with the sound's DECAY): a GHOST a small squash, a FLAM two
 *           (its hit to come a shadow), a ratchet repeated squashes. On EDIT > KIT (EDIT 1) the sound last struck named
 *           over it; on SOUND 1..4 the sound edited lit and named; HOME's BEING for a DRUM track. KIT 2, KIT 3 and
 *           X-MOD keep the colony of 0.5 (ui_being.c graph_colony: a being per sound, in two rows).
 * (JIANT 0.9.6) Six more, ported from the approved mock-up (the family's): line art in the same thermal colours (the JIANT
 * palette: DRUM-X's ramp, the mock-up's; the others as the beings), each moving only with its sound, the bichos' face
 * (vx_face) and outline (vx_blob) shared with DRUM-X's beings:
 *   ANALOG  CÉLULA: a cell whose membrane (three isotherms) is two cycles of the oscillators (WAVE, MORPH, DETUNE, MIX,
 *           NOISE, INT) through the filter (CUT on the note, RES) and DRIVE, in polar form; spikes where DRIVE clips it, a
 *           ring at CUT glowing and spreading with RES, cilia with NOISE, the two oscillators orbiting at DETUNE's beat
 *   FM6     COLONIA: the six operators as bichos wired as the algorithm (FM6_CELL, fm6_routes: carriers on the output's
 *           floor, modulators above), each as large and hot as its LEVEL times its envelope now (the sounding notes'),
 *           its spikes its RATIO, pulses down the wires, FB a curled tail; on EDIT, on OPERATOR / OPERATOR 2 (the
 *           operator picked in the accent, DETUNE a shimmer) and HOME. OP ENV: the envelope, its bicho riding it
 *   WHEEL   TUBÍCOLAS: nine tube worms, one a drawbar, as tall as its level (the digits under them), their crowns as
 *           many tentacles as the harmonic; the rotor a current bending them (its real phase and speed), PERC the
 *           worm it strikes, CLICK bubbles, DUST motes
 *   NOISE   ENJAMBRE: a swarm of protozoa round a queen with a face: COLOR their walk (white jitter .. brown drift), FREQ
 *           their swirl and the ring they keep, PEAK how tight; DUST's impulses flare them; LFSR / META the register
 *           marching in columns, one a bit
 *   PHASE   CARACOL: a snail whose shell's chambers sit at the bent phase (WAVE / WAVE2 at DCW, crowding where it
 *           rushes), the foot's sole the wave, FB frays the spiral, SUB its outer whorl, the eyestalks pulling in on a
 *           note; the second line a little one following (RING a thread)
 *   LOFI    ORGANISMO DE CIRCUITO: a caterpillar whose two skins are the last 256 samples out (the scope's: nothing more
 *           from the audio), 8 segments the byte's bits (BYTE: the highest next to the head; the legs lift with their bit,
 *           the antennae the two lowest), lit by the wave's level elsewhere (FLOAT, PLS TRI SAW NOIS WRAM)
 * Each takes a rectangle (vx_draw: EDIT's left panel, HOME's middle, or a whole panel) and scales to it.
 * State: vxs (in the pool: no global of the RAM region moves). MENU > ANIM OFF: they rest. */
